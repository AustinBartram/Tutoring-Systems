# 📚 Welcome to the Learning Hub!

This workspace is organized to make your learning journey smooth, clear, and easy to follow. Here’s how everything is set up:

## 🎥 **Recorded Lectures**

At the top, you’ll find folders for each unit. Inside the **Recorded Lectures** folder, every topic gets its own subfolder — for example:

* **Linear Equations**
* **Graphing Lines**
* **Systems of Equations**
* *(and more!)*

Each topic folder includes:

### ▶️ **Lesson of the Day**

A recorded video lesson that walks you through the material step-by-step. Perfect for reviewing class content or catching up if you missed something.

### ✏️ **Worksheet**

The worksheet that pairs with the video lesson. These are the same worksheets shown and explained during the recordings, so you can follow along as you watch.
