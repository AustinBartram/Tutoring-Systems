## 📺 Instructional Video  
Watch a clear, step-by-step lesson on solving linear equations and graphing them. While the video does not focus on finding x- or y-intercepts, it covers converting equations into slope-intercept form and using that form to graph accurately.

## 📝 Practice Problems  
Additional problems for self-study:

| #  | Equation in Standard Form |
|----|---------------------------|
| 1  | 3x + 4y = 12             |
| 2  | -2x + 7y = 5             |
| 3  | 5x - y = 20              |
| 4  | (1/3)x + 2y = 10         |
| 5  | 8x + 6y = -24            |
| 6  | 4(x - 2y) = 16           |
| 7  | 9x + 3y = 18             |
| 8  | -4x + y = 11             |
| 9  | 2x - 5y = -15            |
| 10 | (2/5)x - y = 7           |

Graphing practice:

- -6x + 2y = 3  
- y = (3/2)x + 4  
- 3x + y = 6  
- -(2/3)x + y = 4
