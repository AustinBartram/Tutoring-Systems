Here is a video lesson covering how to solve linear equations and how to graph them. While the video does not focus on finding x-intercepts or y-intercepts, it provides a clear explanation of converting equations into slope-intercept form and using that form to create accurate graphs.

You can watch the lesson here on YouTube:

A PDF of the worksheet we worked on is also included below for additional practice.




Linear Equations Worksheet:
Convert each equation into slope-intercept form and fill in the table.
#	Equation in Standard Form	Work (Solving for y)	y = mx + b Form	Slope (m)	y-intercept (b)
1	(3x + 4y = 12)	
	
2	(-2x + 7y = 5)	

3	(5x - y = 20)	
	
4	(1/3x + 2y = 10)	
	
5	(8x + 6y = -24)	
	
6	(4(x - 2y) = 16)	
	
7	(9x + 3y = 18)	
	
8	(-4x + y = 11)	
	
9	(2x - 5y = -15)	
	
10	(2/5x - y = 7)	

Graph: 
1.        (-6x+2y=3)
2.        (y=3/2x+4)
3.        (3x+y=6)
4.        (-2/3x+y=4)
